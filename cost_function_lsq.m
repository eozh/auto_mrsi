cost function for sat band optimization
ALPHA - alpha angles of sat bands
BETA - beta...
D - distances to sat bands
Xb, Yb, Zb - 3d points on the brain surface
wd - distance weight
wp - penalty weight

The cost function measures how "good" the prescription is. The less the
cost function, the better the prescription. It has three terms.

The first term is sum of squares of distances from brain point to the
closest bands. The closer the bands are to the surface, the smaller this
term is.

The second term is a measure of all distances of sat bands from origin. If
the distances get too big - the cost function gets bigger.

The third term - penalty - is a sum of square of the distances of the brain
points outside the sat bands. It penalizes the configurations where the sat
bands encroach on the brain too much.

Weights are used to fine-tune the balance of those factors.
