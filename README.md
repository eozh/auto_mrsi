MRSI placement software has been developed to perform automated prescription of brain 3D MR spectroscopic imaging.
It uses a directory of T1-weighted DICOM images as an input to the automated prescription algorithm and produces two files: sat_bands.dat and press_box.dat.

The automated prescription algorithm and its application is described in the following paper:

Ozhinsky E, Vigneron D B, Nelson S J. Improved spatial coverage for brain 3D PRESS
MRSI by automatic placement of outer-volume suppression saturation bands. Journal of
magnetic resonance imaging 2011;33(4):792-802.

An older version of the technique was described in:

Ozhinsky E, Vigneron DB, Chang SM, Nelson SJ. Automated prescription of oblique
brain 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Magn Reson Med 2012.

Technical details of the implementation have been described in the dissertation titled "Automated Acquisition of Brain MRSI Data" by E. Ozhinsky
