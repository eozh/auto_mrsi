cost function for press box optimization
ALPHA - alpha angles of box faces
BETA - beta...
D - distances to box faces
Xf, Yf, Zf - 3d points on the fat surface
wd - distance weight
wp - penalty weight

The cost function measures how "good" the prescription is. The less the
cost function, the better the prescription. It has two terms.
The distance term estimates the volume of the box. The bigger the volume -
the better the prescription.
The penalty term adds penalty, proportional to sum of squares of the
distances of all the fat points on the "wrong" side of the box. So the
bigger the box grows, the bigger the penalty.
weight constants allow to fine-tune the balance of those factors.

function r = cost_function_inner(ALPHA, BETA, D, Xf, Yf, Zf, wd, wp)

% experimental
% constrain the box within the head

%note: alpha, beta in degrees!

% calculate plane parameters
C = cos(BETA*pi/180);
A = sin(BETA*pi/180).*cos(ALPHA*pi/180);
B = sin(BETA*pi/180).*sin(ALPHA*pi/180);

%A
%B
%C
%X
%Y
%Z


% convert A, B, C, X, Y, Z into matrices of appropriate dimensions

AA = full(A(:)).'; 
BB = full(B(:)).'; 
CC = full(C(:)).'; 
DD = full(D(:)).'; 

XX = full(Xf(:));
YY = full(Yf(:));
ZZ = full(Zf(:));


nx = length(AA); ny = length(XX);

AA = AA(ones(ny, 1),:);
BB = BB(ones(ny, 1),:);
CC = CC(ones(ny, 1),:);
DD = DD(ones(ny, 1),:);


XX = XX(:,ones(1, nx));
YY = YY(:,ones(1, nx));
ZZ = ZZ(:,ones(1, nx));

DP = AA.*XX+BB.*YY+CC.*ZZ-DD;


% DP < 0 means that a point is inside a band

MIND = min(abs(DP),[],2).*prod(double(DP<0),2); %vector only rows where all DP<0, the smallest distances


penalty = sum(MIND.*MIND);

%logic: d_mesure should approximate volume - so it should be ~x^3
root = length(D)/3; 

d_measure = prod(D)^(1/root); % estimates volume, since distances are there twice...

r = -d_measure*wd + penalty*wp;
